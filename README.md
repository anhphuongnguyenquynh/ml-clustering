# Clustering

# Applications:
**1. User Segmentation**
   
I apply Clustering - K-means, K-means++ method for user segmentation with dataset source is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amisha0528/mall-customers-dataset/data

Although K-Mans clustering can be applied to data in higher dimensions, in the first project with this datasource, I use a simple two-dimensional dataset (annual income and spending score) for easier to apply this method. This dataset doesn't require much data pre-processing.
