# Clustering

# Applications:
**1. User Segmentation**

- Application: User segmentation
  
- Methods: K-Means, K-Means++ Clustering

- Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amisha0528/mall-customers-dataset/data

Although K-Mans clustering can be applied to data in higher dimensions, in the first project, I use a simple two-dimensional dataset (annual income and spending score) for easier to apply this method.
